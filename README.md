### Native Stack Navigator vs. Stack Navigator

- `Native Stack` Navigator provides a way for your app to transition between screens where each new
  screen is placed on top of a stack.
- `Native Stack` uses the Android and IOS native navigation systems to navigate between pages ->
  offers NATIVE performance .
- `Native Stack` has an improved performance compared to `Stack`.
- `Stack` does not really "navigate", but instead will mimic navigation in JavaScript and generic
  Views (a bit like how "Single-Page Application" web apps mimic web navigation).

### Drawer Navigator

- `Drawer` Navigator renders a navigation drawer on the side of the screen which can be opened and
  closed via gestures.

### Tab Navigator

- Tab Navigators allow you to add tabbed navigation at different locations in the screen.
- Each tab is linked to a Screen or nested Stack Navigator and displays an active state when
  selected.

### Steps to add a Navigator to `App.js`

- Wrapping your app with <NavigationContainer>
- import `createDrawerNavigator` and define `Drawer`.
- Set the Navigator <Drawer.Navigator>; this component should wrap/register all our screens using
  <Drawer.Screen>
- By default, the top most screen is rendered as the starting screen. We can always set the initial
  route using `initalRouteName` prop.
